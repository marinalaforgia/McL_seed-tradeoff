Column,Description
Species,Species name using updated Jepson Names (only includes subspecies/varieties when there are no other accessions of the same species)
new.code,"6 letter species code (first three letters of genus, first three letters of the species); does not include subspecies"
family,species taxonomic family
group,forb or grass
nat.inv,native or invasive
FunGroup,
appendage.type,"categories: flat, elongated, nutrient-containing, no appendage, balloon structure; when more than one appendage was present, we chose the dominant appendage (i.e., if a seed has both hairs and an awn, we went with awn)"
appendage,"more detailed appendage category (pappus, hairs, hooks, elaiosome, wing)"
disp.cat.all,"dispersal category, includes human dispersal (see Lososová et al 2023)"
disp.cat.nat,"dispersal category, does not include human dispersal (see Lososová et al 2023)"
site,"concatenated site; key: SS = obtained through S&S seeds, MCL-ML = collected by ML at McLLaughlin, MCL-EE = collected by EE at McLaughlin, SFREC = collected at SFREC, UCD = grown from wild collected seed in uc greenhouse, HED = obtained from hedgerow farms, CBG = obtained from the California Botanic Garden, DW = collected by DW in Anza Borrego, CP = Carrizo Plain, MD = Mojave Desert, SD = Sonoran Desert, GRIN = USDA GRIN, SAC = Collected in Sacramento"
new.mass,mass of 100 seeds in mg with persistent appendages only (pappi and other non-persistent appendages removed)
morph.mass.mg,mass of the 100 dispersal units in mg (includes appendages)
chem.mass.mg,mass of 100 seeds in mg (does not include appendages except in asters where the fruit coat (achene) would be too difficult to remove
set.time.mpsec,settling time (falling speed) in meters per second
prop.C,proportion carbon in no less than 5 seeds (no appendages)
prop.N,proportion nitrogen in no less than 5 seeds (no appendages)
height.cm,"plant height, used as a proxy for seed release height and used to categorize dispersal categories, comes either from individual datasets (McLaughlin, Carrizo, Jasper Ridge etc) or from literature"
shape,"unitless number describing the shape of the seed, includes persistent appendages, varies from 0 (round) to 0.2 (needle like)"
size.mm,"Length in mm of the longest seed axis, includes persistent appendages only"
coat.perm.perc,Seed coat permeability percentage (weight of seed after soaking in water fro 24 hours/weight of dry seed)
coat.thick,seed coat thickness (mm)
fruit.thick,fruit coat thickness (mm)
both.thick,fruit + seed coat thickness - this might be the most reliable as it was consistently difficult to measure the true seed coat in achenes
coat.thick.per.width,both.thick/seed width (mm)
wing.loading,morph.mass.mg/area.mm2; indicates how mass is spread out over the seed; lower values indicate higher potential for wind dispersal
ldd.all,"dispersal category numeric, includes human dispersal (see Lososová et al 2023)"
ldd.natural,"dispersal category numeric, does not include human dispersal (see Lososová et al 2023)"
